"""Phase 3/4 integration: the tileset a run produces, and the page that reads it.

Two contracts are under test.

`build_tileset` must not alter the surface: a tile decoded back must equal the
raster it came from, at every LOD, with every pixel accounted for.

`web/` must agree with `traksha/mesh/`. The manifest is the only thing joining a
Python writer to a JavaScript reader, and nothing else in the suite would notice
if the two drifted apart - the page would simply render a wrong surface without
complaining. The checks here are structural (every element the script reaches
for exists; every manifest key it reads is written); `scripts/check_app.js`
executes the page for the rest.
