"""Wavefront OBJ export: the DSM as an actual textured mesh on disk.

The browser viewer is the demo; this is the deliverable. An OBJ plus MTL plus
the aligned texture opens in Blender, MeshLab, CloudCompare and every DCC tool
without a plugin, which makes the output reviewable by someone who will never
install TRAKSHA - the same reason every raster is written as a COG.

Geometry convention, stated once because a silent axis flip here produces a
mesh that looks fine and is mirrored:

    +X  east      (raster +col)
    +Y  north     (raster -row, because +row is south)
    +Z  up        (elevation in metres)

Vertices are in metres relative to the tile's south-west corner, not in CRS
coordinates. A UTM easting of 612345.0 stored as a float32 vertex has about
6 cm of representable precision left, which is coarser than the 0.1 m the
terrain encoding preserves, so the georeference is carried in the sidecar
manifest instead of being baked into vertices that cannot hold it.
